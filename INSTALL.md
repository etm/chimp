```bash
gem install chimp
```

It wont work in a windows terminal for now.

You can utilize 'figlet' (chimp has a plugin).

You can utilize 'img2sixel' if you want to display graphics on your terminal
(chimp has a sixel plugin).

You can utilize 'inkscape' if you want to display svgs as sixel graphics on
your terminal (chimp has a sixel plugin).
